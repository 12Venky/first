Movie Rating Prediction

This project builds a predictive model to estimate movie ratings based on different attributes using IMDb data. The goal is to preprocess data, engineer useful features, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance.

📁 Project Structure

IMDb Movies India.csv - Input dataset

movie_rating_prediction.py - Main code for preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation

README.md - Project documentation
